# Garbage-collector

This project is a multi-agent system based project, it is a simulation of  garbage collectors trying to collect garbage using A* algorithm to find the shortest way to the garbage ..the agents have also to avoid obstacles and not to exist in the same cell at the same step..the first file "projet sma" is composed of two agents collecting two garbages and the second file "projet IA" is composed of only one agent that collects a lot of garbages appearing in a random way in the grid ..You can see screenshots from the execution of this simulation.
